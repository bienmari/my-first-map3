## Tech stack

To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), I used google maps to get the cordantes of the places where i have gone over the summer.
2. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) i used mapbox to get the custamastion for my map and what we used to create my map. 
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) this is where im working on my code right now.
4. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site),  that where i have my map and my code and my first map
